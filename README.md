**Global data grids are not included in this repository**

A copy of the repository including the global data grids has been archived at https://zenodo.org/records/15728101

Source data are stored in **Original_data**

These data can be processed by running the scripts in **Collate_data**

    Calculate_fluxes_explicit.m
    Collate_Horstmann.m
    Collate_MITgcm.m
    Collate_WOA.m

These scripts produce new collated data files that are written to **Data**

Figures can then be reproduced by running the scripts in **Plot_figures**
